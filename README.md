# ðŸ“„ Resume AI Analyzer â€“ iOS App (SwiftUI)

**Resume AI Analyzer** is a mobile application that helps job seekers optimize their resumes by comparing them with job descriptions using on-device AI. It highlights missing keywords and provides instant feedback using Apple's Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities â€“ all without any internet connection.

## âœ¨ Features

- Upload resume in **PDF** format
- Paste job descriptions manually
- AI-driven **keyword extraction** and **matching**
- Highlights **missing keywords**
- **Offline support** â€“ all data stays on the device
- Store and manage previously uploaded resumes
- Swipe-to-delete functionality with animation
- Domain selection for smarter suggestions (e.g. iOS, Data, Design)

## ðŸ§  Architecture

The app follows a **modular MVVM architecture**, with clean separation of views, logic, and storage:

- `HomeView.swift`: Resume uploads, job description input, navigation
- `UploadResumeView.swift`: PDF parsing via PDFKit
- `ResumeResultView.swift`: Keyword matching and result display
- `KeywordAnalyzer.swift`: NLP-based analysis using `NaturalLanguage`
- `StorageManager.swift`: Resume data persistence using `UserDefaults`
